Welcome to the **PrepInterview** — where cutting-edge AI meets interview preparation.  
This project is designed to **simulate real interview experiences**, provide **instant feedback**, and help candidates (and recruiters) **scale interview practice** like never before. Revisit your interviews for feedbacks and check out interviews generated by users across the platform.

Think of it as your **personal AI-powered mock interviewer** that doesn’t get tired, judgmental, or expensive.
