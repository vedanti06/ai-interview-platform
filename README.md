Welcome to the **PrepInterview** — where cutting-edge AI meets interview preparation.  
This project is designed to **simulate real interview experiences**, provide **instant feedback**, and help candidates (and recruiters) **scale interview practice** like never before. Revisit your interviews for feedbacks and check out interviews generated by users across the platform.

Think of it as your **personal AI-powered mock interviewer** that doesn’t get tired, judgmental, or expensive.

## ✨ Why This Project Exists  

Traditional interview prep is either too rigid (question banks) or too costly (mock interviews).  
This platform solves that by combining **Next.js + TypeScript** with **AI capabilities** to create:  

- ⚡ **Real-time practice** — answer AI-driven questions in an interactive environment.  
- 📝 **Instant, structured feedback** — no more guessing where you went wrong.  
- 📊 **Progress tracking** — see how your performance improves over time.  
- 🌐 **Scalable design** — could be used by individuals, bootcamps, or organizations.

## 🚀 Features  

- 🎤 **AI Interviewer Simulation** — Ask and evaluate behavioral/technical questions.  
- 📑 **Feedback Reports** — STAR-format, structured, and ATS-friendly suggestions.  
- 🔐 **Authentication** — Secure login with Firebase.  
- 🎨 **Clean UI** — Built with modern design principles, responsive on all devices.  
- 🌍 **Cloud Ready** — Deploy seamlessly on Vercel or your cloud of choice.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
